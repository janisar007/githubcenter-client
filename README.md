# GitHub Center

A centralized dashboard to manage all your GitHub repositories, workflows, and pull requests across multiple GitHub accounts ‚Äî in one place.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Managing multiple repositories with several GitHub Actions workflows can be time-consuming and tedious.  
**GitHub Center** eliminates the need to check each repository manually by giving you a single interface to:

- View all repositories across one or more GitHub accounts.
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflow runs (passed/failed).
- Track pull request statuses (merged, failed, pending).
- Quickly navigate directly to the repository in GitHub.

---

## üéØ Problem It Solves

> Imagine you have 20 repositories, each with 5+ workflows.  
> Some workflows fail, some pass, and pull requests may be pending or merged.  
> Normally, you'd open each repository daily to check them one by one.  
> **GitHub Center** automates this monitoring process, saving hours of manual work.
